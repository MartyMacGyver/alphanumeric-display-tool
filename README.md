### *--- Alpha release - work in progress! ---*

Run: python alphanumeric-display-tool.pyw

![Sample screenshot](/docs/screenshot.jpg?raw=true)

This was specifically created to help design character sets for use with 16-segment displays (particularly an HT1622-based display), but I'm working on other display formats as well.

Features:
* Edit multi-segment segment display definitions in-place
* Best with Python 3.6+
* Requires Tk (for Tkinter)
* Use "Dump" to dump to the console window (if present)

Future work:
* Enhance extensibility
* Output to file
